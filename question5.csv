Something to the effect: If you need to learn about evaluation, do this, this, and this, or if you need to learn how to celebrate a community event do this, this, and this.  Maybe it would be more work than it's worth in the long-run, but at some point we're going to run out of advisors and it would be empowering if users could access what they need without external guidance, think self-driving car.  On the other hand, I really enjoyed being an advisor as it gave me better insight into what people need to know to better their community work.  I'd be willing to help sort this out if anyone is interested in beginning a dialogue; we do have the technology."
