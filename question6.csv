12,"Apr 11, 2017 10:15 PM","I haven't used it enough yet to say, really. However, the top two seem like they'd be useful."
13,"Apr 11, 2017 7:32 PM","Don't know, I have not seen any of the services on the site"

16,"Apr 11, 2017 8:05 AM",no
17,"Apr 10, 2017 8:49 PM",I would love webinars but they would need to offer CEU for my state (NY). There aren't many CE providers focused on community practice work. Because NY requires 36 CE credits to renew the LMSW I really can only spend money on webinars/workshops that offer social work CE credits in NY.

27,"Apr 6, 2017 2:09 AM","With budgets the way they are currently, I see this site as a God send. While I may want to purchase some of these, I wouldn't be able to. I'm so grateful they are available to use anyway."
28,"Apr 5, 2017 8:20 PM",as before. reuse license
29,"Apr 5, 2017 5:05 PM","I just started browsing your website, I would like a little more time before asked to participate in a survey."

39,"Apr 2, 2017 8:05 PM","Tools to use in the college classroom, hands on activities or simulations for the students to have problem based learning opportunities."
40,"Apr 2, 2017 5:25 PM",specific to higher education. 
41,"Apr 2, 2017 3:26 PM","Our ability to ""purchase"" material is very, very limited."
42,"Mar 31, 2017 6:19 PM",Looking for free of charge online documents.
43,"Mar 31, 2017 1:30 PM","You really should start a coaching service, so we can hire you to provide feedback on what we are doing and what we hope to do."
44,"Mar 31, 2017 3:57 AM",i really like the idea of expanding toolbox to include training components.  short videos (5-15 min) that can be viewed on demand would probably work best for us.
45,"Mar 30, 2017 8:47 PM","Possibly, pending assessment of this website - Thank you"
46,"Mar 30, 2017 5:31 PM",I am willing to take another survey
47,"Mar 30, 2017 2:58 PM","I often find that as I am preparing to develop an approach for a specific community, I am without anyone who I can have frank and open conversations with about concerns or obstacles. Propriety, attribution, credit, and ego frequently halt conversation before it goes anywhere at all. We need an organization to have intelligent conversation with about these topics and it must be without agenda. No organization currently out there allows for this level of conversation. Everyone seems to have an agenda or an organization they are pushing. If we can address this now, than innovation can continue. Otherwise, silo after silo after silo...everyone with the ""right "" answer."
48,"Mar 30, 2017 9:54 AM","Discussing concepts, implementation and approaches with a relevant expert"
49,"Mar 30, 2017 3:12 AM",cant afford to purchase anything
50,"Mar 30, 2017 12:22 AM","I am not in a financial position to make purchases, so unfortunately, no."
51,"Mar 29, 2017 9:27 PM",We have no budget/funding that allow us to pruchase services...
52,"Mar 29, 2017 6:07 PM","Though I must say that as I am based in Zimbabwe, where my income is next to nothing, paying for training would be difficult. So even though I would love to pay for CTB training, I wouldn't be able to.

Alternatively, I would be more than happy to volunteer at the CTB if that mode of payment is valid.

P.S. It is very difficult to pay for international services online from Zimbabwe. Are there any plans for accommodating people/orgs from countries where this is an issue?"
53,"Mar 29, 2017 1:55 PM",I would be interested helping you develop such training (I am a fee based consultant).
54,"Mar 29, 2017 12:42 PM","As far as training in what is available on the Community Tool Box - I would like to see this in the form of a list-serv or email announcement sent out of a regular basis that provides updates on new material, potentially highlights a promising practice and/or program, maybe lists community-based job openings, etc. "
55,"Mar 29, 2017 9:26 AM",I dont et paid market rates and am close to retirement
56,"Mar 28, 2017 7:54 PM",thank you for the priceless work involved here. This has helped with it of social work. Especially empower the most vunrable. The tools give hope and direction. Ewpowers direct action cor complex issues. Priceless.Thank you for sharing. The foundations give a voice to who need it the most.
57,"Mar 28, 2017 7:41 PM",Not currently my F/T does not allow anything additional.
58,"Mar 28, 2017 7:07 PM","no, I strongly disagree with that list.  Do what I`ve suggested publish four how to tool box books.  And tool box is the out of date name.
I am in the United Kingdom."
59,"Mar 28, 2017 5:49 PM","However, one of the greatest benefits to me as a non-profit organization is that the tools are available free of charge... we always have limited training funds, so purchasing these items might be limited."
60,"Mar 28, 2017 5:31 PM","were so much greatful to be our partners in helping the needy in our poor community,we would also seek your help to sponsor one person to come to uk and see also Learn how the Tool box can be of great partner on ;Long term"
61,"Mar 28, 2017 5:02 PM","Not really, no longer in position to use the services."
62,"Mar 28, 2017 4:59 PM","I found you years ago, by accident. I have recommended you to several colleagues, none of whom were aware of you. You probably know that you are a great asset, but a well-kept secret!"
63,"Mar 28, 2017 4:39 PM","I know it takes funds to keep the CTB going, but do we really want to move to a fee-for-service model?  Isn't that antithetical to everything we stand for?  Not in favor of that, no siree. "
64,"Mar 28, 2017 4:38 PM",I'm amazed by the traffic your site receives. Why is this a well-kept secret? This should be getting way more national and international press.
65,"Mar 28, 2017 4:31 PM",depends on the costs
